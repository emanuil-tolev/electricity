# Mounting the 70mai A800SE front and rear dashcam system in a Dacia Spring 45 (2021)

## Project context

### Using the car's 12V battery as a hardwire power source

#### How long will this camera last in parking mode using the car's 12V battery?

##### Measuring the 70mai A800SE actual power consumption

##### Other considerations

- Will this damage the car 12V battery or cause it to degrade faster in any way? Needs online research.
- Is the camera able to cut out its power consumption when a certain 12V battery % is reached?
- Is it possible to see the 12V battery approximate % SoC?
  - inside the car?
  - remotely via an app?

### Using a power bank

You can't and aren't supposed to use phone Li-ion power banks to run a dashcam because of two reasons:
1. Voltage drops when 12V is being provided can make the camera restart, stop or corrupt data on its SD card unexpectedly
2. Li-ion consumer power banks aren't safe for use in the summer in a hot car. LFP (LiFePo4) is recommended instead.

#### 70mai's own power bank - €230

#### Using a custom-built power bank

The goal of this project is to establish the feasability and approximate cost of building a custom power bank out of LFP cells, and if feasible, to actually build one. This will also be an exercise in learning about electricity.
