### Wh vs Ah

Watt-hours are useful when we have an associated device where we know the consumption in watts.

Amper-hours are useful when we know the voltage at which the battery will operate (like 12V for the small accumulator car battery), because then we can talk about charging and discharging the battery in (A)mpere current terms directly.

You can convert between the two of them if you know the battery voltage. (I guess the nominal voltage will give you nominal Ah and Wh values, whereas the real average voltage during different operations will give the real capacities for those operations.)
